# Todo List App

This is a simple and easy-to-use web-based Todo List application built with TypeScript. It helps you keep track of your tasks by allowing you to add, edit, delete, and mark them as complete. Plus, it saves everything in localStorage, so your list stays even if you close your browser.

## Features

- Add new tasks.
- Edit existing tasks if needed.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Remove tasks when they’re done.
- Clear all the tasks at once.
- Tasks stay saved in localStorage so you don’t lose them.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For structure.
- CSS: For styling.
- TypeScript: For adding type safety and structure.
- LocalStorage: For saving tasks between sessions.


## Advantages
- Simple and easy to use.
- Lightweight and fast.
- Data persistence with localStorage.
- No need for external databases or backend services.
- Works offline.


## Disadvantages
- Limited to a single device usage.
- No user authentication or multi-user support.
- Cannot sync tasks across devices.
- Lack of advanced task management features.
- Limited task additions.

## Future improvments

- Drag-and-drop feature for tasks orders.
- Task categories and priority levels.
- Due dates and reminders.
- Implement supabase/firebase instead of local storage.
- Better styling.
